Hearts of Iron 4: Millenium Dawn - Global Balance Mod

Some minor but significant tweaks to significantly improve Millennium Dawn game-play:

o Armour techs research times are tripled, so a nation can't go from T-55s to M1 Abrams in the space of half a year.

o Economic and manpower mobilisation are now reversed at the end of a war when their criteria is no longer met, to reflect the fact that Millennium Dawn is not a 'race to inevitable conflict' but nations need to actually maintain their civilian economies. This prevents early warring nations from having vastly more capabilities than ones which do not, and generally reduces the unrealistic unit spam later in the game until a large world war occurs.

Originally designed for use alongside the Millennium Dawn African Continent mod, but works with vanilla MD to the same effect.
