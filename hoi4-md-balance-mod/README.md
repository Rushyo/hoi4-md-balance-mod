Hearts of Iron 4: Millenium Dawn - Global Balance Mod


SUPPORTS v1.4

The 'harder techs' aspect of this mod has been split from this mod to the Millenium Dawn Harder Techs mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=947333306

This means More Units mod users can still benefit from the improved demobilisation mechanics, whilst also taking advantage of the techs in More Units.

Older version that supports v1.3.3: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3u9scw889eaomjn/hoi4-md-balance-mod-v1000.zip?dl=0 (this version is incompatible with More Units mod).

Some minor but significant tweaks to significantly improve Millennium Dawn game-play:

o Economic and manpower mobilisation are now reversed at the end of a war when their criteria is no longer met, to reflect the fact that Millennium Dawn is not a 'race to inevitable conflict' but nations need to actually maintain their civilian economies. This prevents early warring nations from having vastly more capabilities than ones which do not, and generally reduces the unrealistic unit spam later in the game until a large world war occurs.

o Various minor changes to laws to reduce their impact on the game as the largest single buff, given their relative lack of impact on modern warfare compared to WW2.

Originally designed for use alongside the Millennium Dawn African Continent mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=944700985), but works with vanilla MD to the same effect.
