Hearts of Iron 4: Millenium Dawn - Harder Techs Mod


SUPPORTS v1.4

This mod has been split from the Millenium Dawn Global Balance Tweaks mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=944655401

This means More Units mod users can still benefit from the improved demobilisation mechanics, whilst also taking advantage of the techs in More Units.

This mod is incompatible with More Units, and will shortly be integrated with it for people using that mod.

The effects of this mod are currently limited to a simple but significant improvement:

o Armour techs research times are tripled, so a nation can't go from T-55s to M1 Abrams in the space of half a year

Originally designed for use alongside the Millennium Dawn African Continent mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=944700985), but works with vanilla MD to the same effect.
